# We're all "scientists" here
*In which our writer falls down the science rabbit hole and encounters a mad data scientist*

I'm fairly certain I met Jason's ideas before I really met Jason the Person at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. They tend to show up front and center, like a handshake. As a person who suffers from generalized anxiety disorder, that's just fine with me -- ideal, even. Skip the small talk, and let's get to the meat. These ideas just happened to take me quite a while to chew on before I could fully digest them.

I'm a writer, and I've made a career out of staying close to science and research so I can communicate complex topics to mostly lay audiences. But please make no mistake that I am also a member of these lay audiences. This is also why words like "repository," "codify," "software correctness," and my personal favorite, "reify," didn't exactly register with me when Jason first brought them up —- quite excitedly, I might add. 

## Peering in the keyhole
With only two months physically at the lab under my belt, and a world of research still to understand, I felt like Alice in Wonderland, still peering through the garden keyhole, unsure of how to open the door — or why I should, honestly. 

He talked about how we might make writing scietific papers easier by creating standardized definitions of commonly used terms and storing them in a repository so researchers could pick and pull what they needed, rather than writing an introduction from scratch every time (an introduction someone else has also written, in different words, was his point). The definitions would be standardized, reviewed, and blessed by the powers that be, solidifying their credibility, and even providing some other folks with authorship credits (what we in the writing industry might call bylines). 

Intuitively, this all made sense, but the why and how of it weren't completely clear to me at the time

"...and then it's just... science all the way down!" I remember him excitedly wrapping up an ideation session where I did my best to hang on through the twists and turns down the rabbit hole. *I sure do like science,* I remember thinking. *But I don't DO the science*

Other ~~magical dreams~~ ideas he had included a centralized, accessible list of all current projects within the divison, directorate and, ideally, lab-wide. No, this shockingly doesn't exist, as of this publication. Further, "what if you could search, find project dates, fill unmet needs or even update project fact sheets?!" 

## DRINK ME | EAT ME 
Once down the rabbit hole, I wasn't sure what was on the other side of the first door until the day our communications team discussed updating the website. 

This included organizing the directorate's fact sheets. Without getting too specific, we needed updated project fact sheets in a standardized format and in a centralized location. We needed our researchers to be able to edit them, with some version control. We needed freedom with guardrails and open, shareable science. 

Jason, of course, had the solution and an opening for Science All the Way Down — the key to the garden door. The solution was GitLab... and I found myself, mid-career, non-scientist, moderate tech literacy, learning Git so I could open the door. 

Except after downing the "DRINK ME" potion and opening my first Git tutorial, I discovered I left the key on the table and I was too small to reach it: I couldn't start Git without first learning command line. 

And so the EAT ME cake that allowed me to grow and reach the key was a crash course in command line. Learning this new language gave me acccess to a new world. I could open and find lost files and experienced better word processing and superior file storage. Even for a writer, these were incredibly useful tools to hang on my belt.  

Finally, I was able to gain a vague understanding of Git. Enough to open the door. Enough to finally, **finally** understand the benefits we could reap with Science All the Way Down. Far beyond fact sheets.
