# We're all "scientists" here
*In which our writer falls down the science rabbit hole and encounters a mad data scientist*

I'm fairly certain I met Jason's ideas before I really met Jason the Person at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. They tend to show up front and center, like a handshake. As a person who suffers from generalized anxiety disorder, that's just fine with me -- ideal, even. Skip the small talk, and let's get to the meat. These ideas just happened to take me quite a while to chew on before I could fully digest them.

I'm a writer, and I've made a career out of staying close to science and research so I can communicate complex topics to mostly lay audiences. But please make no mistake that I am also a member of these lay audiences. This is also why words like "repository," "codify," "software correctness," and my personal favorite, "reify," didn't exactly register with me when Jason first brought them up —- quite excitedly, I might add. 

## Peering in the keyhole
With only two months physically at the lab under my belt, and a world of research still to understand, I felt like Alice in Wonderland, still peering through the garden keyhole, unsure of how to open the door — or why I should, honestly. 

He talked about how we might make writing scietific papers easier by creating standardized definitions of commonly used terms and storing them in a repository so researchers could pick and pull what they needed, rather than writing an introduction from scratch every time (an introduction someone else has also written, in different words, was his point). The definitions would be standardized, reviewed, and blessed by the powers that be, solidifying their credibility, and even providing some other folks with authorship credits (what we in the writing industry might call bylines). 

Intuitively, this all made sense, but the why and how of it weren't completely clear to me at the time

"...and then it's just... science all the way down!" I remember him excitedly wrapping up an ideation session where I did my best to hang on through the twists and turns down the rabbit hole. *I sure do like science,* I remember thinking. *But I don't DO the science*

Other ~~magical dreams~~ ideas he had included a centralized, accessible list of all current projects within the divison, directorate and, ideally, lab-wide. No, this shockingly doesn't exist, as of this publication. Further, "what if you could search, find project dates, fill unmet needs or even update project fact sheets?!" 

## DRINK ME | EAT ME 
Once down the rabbit hole, I wasn't sure what was on the other side of the first door until the day our communications team discussed updating the website. 

This included organizing the directorate's fact sheets. Without getting too specific, we needed updated project fact sheets in a standardized format and in a centralized location. We needed our researchers to be able to edit them, with some version control. We needed freedom with guardrails and open, shareable science. 

Jason, of course, had the solution and an opening for Science All the Way Down — the key to the garden door. The solution was GitLab... and I found myself, mid-career, non-scientist, moderate tech literacy, learning Git so I could open the door. 

Except after downing the "DRINK ME" potion and opening my first Git tutorial, I discovered I left the key on the table and I was too small to reach it: I couldn't start Git without first learning command line. 

And so the EAT ME cake that allowed me to grow and reach the key was a crash course in command line. Learning this new language gave me acccess to a new world. I could open and find lost files and experienced better word processing and superior file storage. Even for a writer, these were incredibly useful tools to hang on my belt.  

Finally, I was able to gain a vague understanding of Git. Enough to open the door. Enough to finally, **finally** understand the benefits we could reap with Science All the Way Down. Far beyond fact sheets. 

## Finding Wonderland: Science All the Way Down

Sometimes when I tell people I'm a writer, I get responses akin to, "Oh, good for you, I could never be a writer." And my response is, "Sorry, but you already are." Everyone is to some degree.Whether you're composing emails, drafting journal publications about your quantum physics research or writing school excuse notes for your kid, you are writing. Everyone needs some semblance of communication skills to put a subject and a predicate together to present an idea or express a need. 

The same, I've learned, can be true for being a scientist. Jason was telling me about going to a high school career fair with our video intern recently. As students came up to the laboratory's table, our intern emphasized that while she could talk about her skills in media she was expressly, "*not* a scientist." Jason pushed back that, in some ways, she was absolutely a scientist. She gathers raw data (footage), examines it, makes assumptions based on the data (video storyboards), tests the hypothesis (producing a video and gathering feedback), further refines the output and then shares it.

I can't speak for anyone else, but when I started to look at my daily world through the lens of "sciencing," I started to see patterns. And, for perhaps the first time in my life, I started to see a need for process, consistency, and automation.

In this new POV, I found: 
- Many of the repeating tasks I'm doing each week, or even daily, should be automated
- When working shoulder-to-shoulder with people who hold the same or similar job responsibilities, we should have an agreed-upon process so our outputs structure is predictable and accessible
- By doing the two things above, we can more easily gain buy-in and traction from the folks who matter, whether that's leadership, the general public, and/or funding sources. They know what they're looking for, where they'll find it, and what the message is — a purist journalist's dream. 
- Everything we produce, especially in an environment that touts the importance of "big science" should be accessible and open to continue the momentum of consistent improvement
**And, perhaps my favorite part**
- When we automate, template, and, yes, even *reify* these concepts, we create time and space for creativity. And this is where the ~~magic~~ science happens. 

And so we find ~~Alice~~ myself still wandering through Wonderland, more comfortably now. There are still surprising and, at times, frustrating new creatures around every corner. Cheshire cats present new widgets and development terms to learn; Tea parties celebrating half birthdays that suck time from where I need it most; And games of croquet where I can't get the ball through the wicket to save my life. 

But I wouldn't want to be anywhere else. I must be a "scientist." Or I wouldn't have come here.
